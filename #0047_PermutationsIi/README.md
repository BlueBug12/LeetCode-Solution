# [47. Permutations II](https://leetcode.com/problems/permutations-ii/)

## Description

Given a collection of numbers that might contain duplicates, return all possible unique permutations.

```example
Input: [1,1,2]
Output:
[
  [1,1,2],
  [1,2,1],
  [2,1,1]
]
```

## Solution
I use exactly the same solution from [46. Permutations](https://github.com/BlueBug12/LeetCode-Solution/tree/master/%230046_Permutations). I also write another recursion solution, but it need more space to check the duplicated elements.

_**Time complexity: O(n*n!)**_ (the time complexity of next_permutation is O(n))

## Summary
I'm a fucking lazy person.
