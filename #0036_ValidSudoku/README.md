# [36. Valid Sudoku](https://leetcode.com/problems/valid-sudoku/)

## Description

Determine if a 9x9 Sudoku board is valid. Only the filled cells need to be validated according to the following rules:
1. Each row must contain the digits 1-9 without repetition.
2. Each column must contain the digits 1-9 without repetition.
3. Each of the 9 3x3 sub-boxes of the grid must contain the digits 1-9 without repetition.

```example
Input:
[
  ["5","3",".",".","7",".",".",".","."],
  ["6",".",".","1","9","5",".",".","."],
  [".","9","8",".",".",".",".","6","."],
  ["8",".",".",".","6",".",".",".","3"],
  ["4",".",".","8",".","3",".",".","1"],
  ["7",".",".",".","2",".",".",".","6"],
  [".","6",".",".",".",".","2","8","."],
  [".",".",".","4","1","9",".",".","5"],
  [".",".",".",".","8",".",".","7","9"]
]
Output: true
```

## Solution
Check all elements follow three rules, and use two-levels for loop to implement.

_**Time complexity: O(n^2)**_

## Summary
If the matrix is sparse, using set or map instaed of vector to record elements may decrease the demands of memory.
