# [50. Pow(x, n)](https://leetcode.com/problems/powx-n/)

## Description

Implement pow(x, n), which calculates x raised to the power n (xn).

```example
Input: 2.00000, 10
Output: 1024.00000
```

## Solution
Use function [_pow_](https://en.cppreference.com/w/cpp/numeric/math/pow) in c++ library.

There is another recursion solution provided by [Escanor01

_**Time complexity: O(logn)**_

## Summary
Easy. But the soultion 2 it's ingeneous, you should take a look at it.
