# [29. Divide Two Integers](https://leetcode.com/problems/divide-two-integers/)

## Description

Given two integers dividend and divisor, divide two integers without using multiplication, division and mod operator.

```example
Input: dividend = 10, divisor = 3
Output: 3
```

## Solution
Be careful of the special case, and use **_unsigned int_** to make it more convenient. At last, keep substarting like a stupid.


## Summary
It's very inefficient to implement division in sofeware rather than hardware.
